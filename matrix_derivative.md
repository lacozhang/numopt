###Matrix Derivative
One of the key points in numerical optimization is to calculate the gradient and hessian of objective function or constraints (if constrained optimization) with respect to multivariate variable. 
But the derivation of gradient and hessian for any type of objection function is hard. The derivation of derivative has its own rule and definition. All the related are called vector calculus and matrix calculus.
